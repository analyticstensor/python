It has been heavily adopted in educational, engineering, analytics and scienctific purpose as well as business and economics for designing enterprise application. According to Tiobe$^2$, Python is on top 3 among all the programming language. There are various reasons for the popularity of python such as:  \n",
    "-  Open source, free of charge with large open-source supporting community.  \n",
    "-  Easier to learn compared to C, C++, Java and .Net  \n",
    "-  Easier to read  \n",
    "-  Extensive standard libraries and third party open-source libarires.   \n",
    "-  Support concurrency with asyncio and async/await  \n",
    "-  Used to build app like Youtube, Instagram, Dropbox, Reddit etc.\n",
    "-  Popular in ML and AI for Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Vision and Image Recoginition.  \n",
