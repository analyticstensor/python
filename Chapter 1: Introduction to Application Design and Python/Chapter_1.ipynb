Python is now becoming one of most popular programming language. It has been heavily adopted in educational, engineering, analytics and scienctific purpose as well as business and economics for designing enterprise application. According to [tiobe](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), Python is on top 3 among all the programming language. There are various reasons for the popularity of python such as:  \n",
    "-  Open source, free of charge with large open-source supporting community.  \n",
    "-  Easier to learn compared to C, C++, Java and .Net  \n",
    "-  Easier to read  \n",
    "-  Extensive standard libraries and third party open-source libarires.   \n",
    "-  Support concurrency with asyncio and async/await  \n",
    "-  Used to build app like Youtube, Instagram, Dropbox, Reddit etc.\n",
    "-  Popular in ML and AI for Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Vision and Image Recoginition.  \n",
    "-  Programmer are highly paid for data engineering and data scientist jobs.  \n",
    "-  Gained popularity in statistical and visualization application compared to R.\n",
