    "\n",
    "**Advantages of OOP:-**  \n",
    "* **Software Development Productivity**: OOP is modular since the functionality are seperated based on the required task. OOP is extensible if we need to add new attributes or behaviors. Same object can be reused on multiple place. With `modularity, extensibility, and reusability` features, the software development productivity is gained higher compared to other methods.\n",
    "* **Software Maintainability**: OOP are easier to maintain due to flexibility of modularity. Only the parts of the modular need to updated if there is an issue or update the program.\n",
    "* **Software Quality**: The software will have always higher quality by breaking all the dependency and functionality. The quality always depends upon the experience of developer.\n",
    "* **Rapid Development**: The reusability helps to reduce the repeatation of code. Mostly, all the OOP has rich built-in libraries which helps develop faster.\n",
    "* **Cost of Development**: Due to the reusability, the cost will always be lower once designed initially. The cost is only higher on design phase which needs lots of iteration and modification to build the prototype of software."
